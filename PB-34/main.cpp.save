Program:
C++ program to Calculate the Power of a Number.

# Breakdown:
- How to Calculate the Power of a Number
2^2 = 4
2 * 2 = 4

2^3 = 8
2 * 2 * 2 = 8

- How to use pow
pow(a, b) = a^b

- Do/While Loop
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
(https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_do_while_loop.asp)

Input:
power (int)

# Variable(s)
int power, number=2

# Method
None

Input:


Process:


Output:


Return:


Process:
- Inside a do/while loop
    - Ask user for power which between 0 and 100
        Please enter power between 0 and 100:
- Check in while until following conditions is false
    > power needs to less than or equal to 0
    OR
    > power needs to bigger than or equal to 100
    power <= 0 || power > 100
- Output 2^power
    2^power = result
    2^3 = 8

# Dependency:
#include <cmath>

Output:
Result of 2^power
