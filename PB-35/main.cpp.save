Program:
Factorial Calculator: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer.
Factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers from 1 to that number.


# Breakdown:
- How to calculate the factorial of a number
The value n! is called "n factorial" and is calculated by following formula:

n! = n × (n - 1) × (n - 2) × . . . × 1  ,  n > 0

By convention, 0! = 1

For example, the factorial of 7 is equal to 7×6×5×4×3×2×1 = 5040.

Input:
number (int)

# Variable(s)
int numberZeroFactorial = 1
int number = user
int sum = 1

# Method
None

Process:


Output:


Return:


Process:
- Get number from user
    - Please enter a positive intger:
- Check
if
    number is zero
then
    Output
    Factorial of (input number) is 1
else
    - For loop starting from 1 to number inclusive
        - number = 10
            for 1 to 10
                sum *= i
    - Output the sum as Factorial
    - Factorial of 10 (input number) is 3,628,800


# Dependency:
None

Output:
Factorial Number
