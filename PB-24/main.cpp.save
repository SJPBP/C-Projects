Program:
Nested condition
> Get the 'age' and 'membership_status' as user input.
  'membership_status' can be only 'Y' or 'y'.
  So, if the age is bigger or equal to 18 and if the user is a member of our shop, we provide a 10% discount, else we charge fully.

- How to apply 10%
To get 10% of 200

First move decimal point 1 right of 200.0 -> 20.0
So 10% of 200 is 20.0

Second to get 1%, move 1 right of 20.0 -> 2.0
so 1% of 200 is 2.0

Or using calculator
200 * (10/100) = 20.0

- How to get 10% discount or charged fully.
if
    age >= 18 && membership_status == 'Y" || membership_status == 'y'
then
    User get discount on payment using:
    payment = payment * (10/100)
else
    Pay payment fully


Input:
age (int)
membership_status (char)
payment (int)

# Variable(s)
int age = user
int payment = user
char membership_status = user
const int discount_percent = 10

# Method
None

Input:


Process:


Output:


Return:


Process:
- Ask for age and membership_status and payment
- Check
if
    age >= 18 && membership_status == 'Y" || membership_status == 'y'
then
    Calculate payment with 10% discount
    payment = payment * (10/100)
    Output discounted payment
else
    Output Full payment without any discount

# Dependency:
None

Output:
payment with/without 10% discount
