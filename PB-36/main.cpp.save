Program:
Prime Number Checker: Create a program that determines whether a given number is prime or not.
A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

# Breakdown:
- How to check if number is prime

> Number less than or equal 1 cannot be prime
> Check if number is divided evenly from 2 to number/2

> If number is 10
> As number is bigger that 1 it can be a prime number
> Loop through 2 to 10/2=5
    > If number can be divided by iteration
        and return 0 remainder
        10 / 2..5 == 0
    > Then number is not prime number
        10 is not a prime number

Process:
> Ask user for positive integer
    - Please enter a positive number:
> Check if
        *number* is less than or equal to 1
        - number <= 1
    then
        isPrimeNumber = false

> Else
    - Loop through from 2 to *number* / 2
        - Check
            if *number* evenly divided by iteration
                - *number* / iteration == 0
            then
                isPrimeNumber = false
> Check if
        isPrimeNumber is true
    then
        output *number* is a prime number
        - *number* is a prime number!!!
    else
        output *number* can't be prime number
        - *number* can't be a prime number!!!
